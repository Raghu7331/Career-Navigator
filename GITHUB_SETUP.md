# 🚀 Push Career Navigator to GitHub - Step by Step Guide

## 📋 Prerequisites Checklist

Before you start, make sure you have:
- ✅ Git installed on your computer
- ✅ GitHub account created ([Sign up here](https://github.com/signup))
- ✅ Git configured with your name and email (Already done! ✅)

---

## 🎯 Quick Push (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create New Repository on GitHub

1. **Go to GitHub:** https://github.com/new
2. **Repository Settings:**
   - **Name:** `career-navigator` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description:** "Full-stack career guidance platform with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB"
   - **Visibility:** Choose Public or Private
   - **❌ DO NOT** check "Add a README file"
   - **❌ DO NOT** check "Add .gitignore"
   - **❌ DO NOT** choose a license yet
3. **Click:** "Create repository"

### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Project

Open PowerShell in your project folder and run:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Raghu Ram\OneDrive\Desktop\Last Hop"
git init
```

### Step 3: Add All Files to Git

```powershell
git add .
```

### Step 4: Create First Commit

```powershell
git commit -m "Initial commit: Career Navigator platform with React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB"
```

### Step 5: Add Your GitHub Repository as Remote

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username:

```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/career-navigator.git
```

**Example:**
```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/Raghu7331/career-navigator.git
```

### Step 6: Push to GitHub

```powershell
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**If prompted for credentials:**
- Username: Your GitHub username
- Password: Use a **Personal Access Token** (not your GitHub password)

---

## 🔑 GitHub Personal Access Token (Required for HTTPS)

GitHub no longer accepts passwords. You need to create a Personal Access Token:

### Create Token:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click: **"Generate new token"** → **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. **Settings:**
   - **Note:** "Career Navigator Project"
   - **Expiration:** 90 days (or longer)
   - **Scopes:** Check `repo` (this gives full control of private repositories)
4. Click: **"Generate token"**
5. **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again!)
6. **Use this token** as your password when pushing to GitHub

---

## 🔄 Complete PowerShell Commands (Copy-Paste Ready)

```powershell
# Navigate to project
cd "C:\Users\Raghu Ram\OneDrive\Desktop\Last Hop"

# Initialize Git
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# First commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Career Navigator platform"

# Add remote (REPLACE YOUR-USERNAME!)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/career-navigator.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 📝 Alternative: Using GitHub Desktop (Easier)

If you prefer a GUI:

1. **Download GitHub Desktop:** https://desktop.github.com/
2. **Install and login** with your GitHub account
3. **Click:** File → Add Local Repository
4. **Select:** `C:\Users\Raghu Ram\OneDrive\Desktop\Last Hop`
5. **Click:** "Publish repository"
6. Choose repository name and visibility
7. **Click:** "Publish Repository"

✅ Done! Much easier!

## 🛡️ What Gets Pushed (Safe)

Your `.gitignore` file protects sensitive data:

### ✅ WILL BE PUSHED:
- All source code (frontend & backend)
- README.md and documentation
- Package.json files
- Configuration files (except .env)

### ❌ WILL NOT BE PUSHED:
- `node_modules/` (too large, can be reinstalled)
- `.env` file (contains secrets!)
- `uploads/` folder (user uploads)
- Log files
- Build output

---

## 🔐 Security Check Before Pushing

**VERIFY YOUR .ENV IS NOT INCLUDED:**

```powershell
git status
```

You should **NOT** see `.env` in the list!

If you see `.env`, run:
```powershell
git rm --cached backend/.env
git commit -m "Remove .env from tracking"
```

---

## 📊 Verify Your Push

After pushing, verify on GitHub:

1. Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/career-navigator`
2. You should see:
   - ✅ `backend/` folder
   - ✅ `frontend/` folder
   - ✅ `README.md`
   - ✅ `CREDENTIALS.md`
   - ✅ Other documentation files
3. Check that `backend/.env` is **NOT** visible (should be ignored)

## 🚀 Future Updates (After Initial Push)

When you make changes to your project:

```powershell
# Check what changed

# Add changes
git add .

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Description of changes"
